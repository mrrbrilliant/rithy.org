# Rithy.org [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/rithythul/rithy.org.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/rithythul/rithy.org)


This is a transition from rithythul.com to rithy.org 

rithy.org represents my personal reflections on life, and is dedicated to my work and service toward humanitarian efforts. 

Over the past decade, I have been fortunate to have met many great people who have become mentors, supporters, and friends. 

I have received so much positive support from them, that now has become my time to give back.

This is my personal website, a reflection of my being, my experiences, principles, philosophy, work and play.

To-do for the site

- add img/media
- add short desc to pages
- add google analytic

This is a transition from rithythul.com to rithy.org

rithy.org represents my personal reflections on life, and is dedicated to my work and service toward humanitarian efforts.

Over the past decade, I have been fortunate to have met many great people who have become mentors, supporters, and friends.

I have received so much positive support from them, that now has become my time to give back.

I will write about my thought & reflection of my being, my experiences, principles, philosophy, work and play. Hope this will help some people who can make use of it.

I hope to one day contribute bigger things, than just writing. Will first let's it flow, then let hope it will glow. Or let's it be!

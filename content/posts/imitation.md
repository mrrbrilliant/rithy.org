Imitation is a great to train and change habit. Imitation is a way to download information from outside into our autopilot mode, if we do enough. 

Base on Wikipedia, imitation is an advanced behavior whereby an individual observes and replicates anther's behavior. Imitation is also a form of social learning that leads to the "development of traditions, and ultimately our culture.

Imitation is very powerful, so we should learn to imitate good things and habits. I have been building an imitation program based on suggestion from "The Magic of Thinking Big", which recommend to choose role models or somebody we respects such as religious leaders, scientists, business leaders and the like to imitate. 

When I think about role model whose work and life choices inspired me, names that pop up in my mind are Nikola Tesla, George Westinghouse, Steve Wozniak, Linus Torvalds, Alexander the Great, Abraham Lincoln, Buddha, Jesus, Forest Gump, Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, William Li, Jeff Bezo, Jack Ma, my parents and many more.

I would ask myself very often when I started to do things or think about things. The question goes as **what would they do, if they are ...?**

Example situations; 

- When idea emerge: what would **Tesla**, **Waz** or **Jobs** do with this idea?

- When I worry: would **Buddha** and **Jesus** worry about such thing? What would they do if they are in my situation right now?

- Temper: would **Buddha** or **Forest Gump** get mad with what I am mad at right now? What would he do if he is in my situation now? 

- Language: am I using the language **Abraham** or **Jobs** would use? 
i 
- Discussion: is this the conversation **Alexander**, **Elon** or **Westinghouse** would talk about? 

- Reading: would self-taught people like **Tesla**, **Elon**, **Ma** read this things?

- Jokes: is this the joke **Linus**, *Waz*, or **Jobs** would tell? 

- Job: how would they describe about their works to others?

- Apparent: Do I look like I would have maximum self respect and self esteem like any of them?

This has been very help reminder to be mindful of how I invest my time on things to think about or to do. 

Imitation is very powerful. In the the era of information overloaded and news-feed, we are distracted from what most important to us and what is truthful to our life. If we are not mindful of who we imitate, we would accidentally imitate unhappy people and click-bait contents that poison our mind. 

If imitation that powerful, why don't we use it to do good for our lives and others. We should not be the victim of technology, but thrive above it.

What created our universe? 

Was our universe a result of a big bang?

The big bang is how we often explain the way our universe began. 

It's a theory that the universe began from a single point in space, and then began expanding.

Over the years it has grown to be as large as it is now, and it's continues to grow.

I wonder, what was there before this big bang?

If we assume there was nothing, then all that exists comes from from nothing. 

But instead of a universe, let's consider a multiverse.

A multiverse is another theory, a theory of multiple universes. 

Within these multiple universes, everything exists.

All of space, time, matter, energy, and information.
